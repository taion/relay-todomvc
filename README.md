## Notes

- Most of the code is taken directly from [the official example](https://github.com/relayjs/relay-examples/tree/master/todo) and falls under [the license there](https://github.com/relayjs/relay-examples/tree/master/todo#license).
- The `yarn start` command runs webpack-dev-server, and accepts other options, e.g. `yarn start --port 5000`.
