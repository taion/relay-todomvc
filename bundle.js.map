node in the traversal, and calling the\n * leave function after visiting that node and all of its child nodes.\n *\n * By returning different values from the enter and leave functions, the\n * behavior of the visitor can be altered, including skipping over a sub-tree of\n * the AST (by returning false), editing the AST by returning a value or null\n * to remove the value, or to stop the whole traversal by returning BREAK.\n *\n * When using visit() to edit an AST, the original AST will not be modified, and\n * a new version of the AST with the changes applied will be returned from the\n * visit function.\n *\n *     const editedAST = visit(ast, {\n *       enter(node, key, parent, path, ancestors) {\n *         // @return\n *         //   undefined: no action\n *         //   false: skip visiting this node\n *         //   visitor.BREAK: stop visiting altogether\n *         //   null: delete this node\n *         //   any value: replace this node with the returned value\n

leave() functions, a visitor can\n * instead provide functions named the same as the kinds of AST nodes, or\n * enter/leave visitors at a named key, leading to four permutations of\n * visitor API:\n *\n * 1) Named visitors triggered when entering a node a specific kind.\n *\n *     visit(ast, {\n *       Kind(node) {\n *         // enter the \"Kind\" node\n *       }\n *     })\n *\n * 2) Named visitors that trigger upon entering and leaving a node of\n *    a specific kind.\n *\n *     visit(ast, {\n *       Kind: {\n *         enter(node) {\n *           // enter the \"Kind\" node\n *         }\n *         leave(node) {\n *           // leave the \"Kind\" node\n *         }\n *       }\n *     })\n *\n * 3) Generic visitors that trigger upon entering and leaving any node.\n *\n *     visit(ast, {\n *       enter(node) {\n *         // enter any node\n *       },\n *       leave(node) {\n *         // leave any node\n *       }\n *     })\n *\n * 4) Parallel visitors for entering and leaving nodes of a specific kind.\n *\n *     visit(ast, {\n *       enter: {\n *         Kind(node) {\n *           // enter the \"Kind\" node\n *         }\n *       },\n *       leave: {\n *

The object\n *   keys determine the prop names by which fragment data is available.\n * - `connectionConfig`: an object that determines how to load more connection\n *   data. Details below.\n *\n * # Loading More Data\n *\n * Use `props.relay.hasMore()` to determine if there are more items to load.\n *\n * ```\n * hasMore(): boolean\n * ```\n *\n * Use `props.relay.isLoading()` to determine if a previous call to `loadMore()`\n * is still pending. This is convenient for avoiding duplicate load calls.\n *\n * ```\n * isLoading(): boolean\n * ```\n *\n * Use `props.relay.loadMore()` to load more items. This will return null if\n * there are no more items to fetch, otherwise it will fetch more items and\n * return a Disposable that can be used to cancel the fetch.\n *\n * `pageSize` should be the number of *additional* items to fetch (not the\n * total).\n *\n * ```\n * loadMore(pageSize: number, callback: ?(error: ?Error) => void): ?Disposable\n * ```\n *\n * A complete example:\n *\n * ```\n * class Foo extends React.Component {\n *   ...\n *   _onEndReached() {\n *     if (!this.props.relay.hasMore() || this.props.relay.isLoading()) {\n *       return;\n *     }\n *     this.props.relay.loadMore(10);\n *   }\n *   ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * # Connection Config\n *\n * Here's an example, followed by details of each config property:\n *\n * ```\n * ReactRelayPaginationContainer.createContainer(\n *   Component,\n *   {\n *     user: graphql`fragment FriendsFragment on User {\n *       friends(after: $afterCursor first: $count) @connection {\n *         edges { ... }\n *         pageInfo {\n *           startCursor\n *           endCursor\n *           hasNextPage\n *           hasPreviousPage\n *         }\n *       }\n *     }`,\n *   },\n *   {\n *     direction: 'forward',\n *     getConnectionFromProps(props) {\n *       return props.user && props.user.friends;\n *     },\n *     getFragmentVariables(vars, totalCount) {\n *       // The component presumably wants *all* edges, not just those after\n *       // the cursor, so notice that we don't set $afterCursor here.\n *       return {\n *         ...vars,\n *         count: totalCount,\n *       };\n *     },\n *     getVariables(props, {count, cursor}, fragmentVariables) {\n *       return {\n *         id: props.user.id,\n *         afterCursor: cursor,\n *         count,\n *       },\n *     },\n *     query: graphql`\n *       query FriendsQuery($id: ID!, $afterCursor: ID, $count: Int!) {\n *         node(id: $id) {\n *           ...FriendsFragment\n *         }\n *       }\n *     `,\n *   }\n * );\n * ```\n *\n * ## Config Properties\n *\n * - `direction`: Either \"forward\" to indicate forward pagination using\n *   after/first, or \"backward\" to indicate backward pagination using\n *   before/last.\n * - `getConnectionFromProps(props)`: PaginationContainer doesn't magically know\n *   which connection data you mean to fetch more of (a container might fetch\n *   multiple connections, but can only paginate one of them). This function is\n *   given the fragment props only (not full props), and should return the\n *   connection data. See the above example that returns the friends data via\n *   `props.user.friends`.\n * - `getFragmentVariables(previousVars, totalCount)`: Given the previous variables\n *   and the new total number of items, get the variables to use when reading\n *   your fragments. Typically this means setting whatever your local \"count\"\n *   variable is to the value of `totalCount`. See the example.\n * - `getVariables(props, {count, cursor})`: Get the variables to use when\n *   fetching the pagination `query`. You may determine the root object id from\n *   props (see the example that uses `props.user.id`) and may also set whatever\n *   variables you use for the after/first/before/last calls based on the count\n *   and cursor.\n * - `query`: A query to use when fetching more connection data.
